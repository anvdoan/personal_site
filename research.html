      <h2>SPI Lab</h2>
        <p> I am currently a member of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab. I am supervised by Professor Florian Schaub and some of his graduate students. At spilab, we research people’s privacy and security behaviors; design, develop, and evaluate usable privacy and security interventions and solutions; explore privacy by design; and consider public policy interventions and implications for privacy and security.
          You can check out our site <a class="spilab_link" href="https://spilab-umich.github.io/ " target="_blank">here</a> (note: our website is <b>very</b> in progress)
        </p>
      <h2>Privacy Impact Assessment for Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p>I, along with two other spilab members, are working on evaluating currently available privacy impact assessments and creating an assessment that is usable and relevant to virtual reality developers. Privacy impact assessments are being used more widely since the GDPR now requires it.
           However, these assessments are often abstract and require third parties to be brought in, which isn’t feasible for many smaller companies.
         </p>
      <h2>Data Consent Framework for Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p> I and some other spilab members are working on editing the privacy framework created by the Extended Reality Safety Initiative (XRSI). We also have been working to create an article to be published separately that will focus on data consent and will feature speculative privacy by design ideas for virtual reality. </p>
      <h2>Feminist Health Technology</h2>
        <p>I am in the process of creating a topic proposal and literature review for my undergraduate thesis on how women and trans/non-binary people are constructed through health technologies that are “genderless” and through tech that is made for them. I was very inspired by the work of Judith Butler and cyberfeminist work in the early 90’s, and I’m excited to combine feminist theory with UX research methods. </p>
      <h2>Trauma Studies</h2>
        <p>I am working on my independent research project for HS 495: Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Trauma, and my project focuses on trauma exposures on social media and ways to prevent or mitigate the harms caused by them. It is an emerging topic and it is fascinating to learn about it.</p>
