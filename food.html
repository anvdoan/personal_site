      <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>Fun fact that most people don’t know about me: I was a sushi chef for a year! It was way less stressful than being a waitress and I made more money, so it is one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. Today, sushi making is a fun skill I get to break out occasionally.</p>

      <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <p>After my stint as a sushi chef, I worked as a barista at Espresso Royale (RIP). I loved my coworkers and I learned a lot about making coffee in the process. Currently, I live with two of my former coworkers and we try to make all of our coffee and espresso drinks at home.</p>

      <h2>Kombucha</h2>
        <p>Since last year, I’ve been brewing my own kombucha. I mostly started doing it because I realized that I didn’t want to spend four dollars on a bottle of store-bought kombucha. Since then, I’ve realized that it’s a great way to use overripe fruit and it’s incredible low maintenance. I’ve always got plenty of SCOBYs and extra kombucha lying around, and I’m always willing to give them away.</p>

      <h2>Home Cooking</h2>
        <p>I’ve always loved to cook and it honestly is one of my favorite self-care activities to do. Especially during the pandemic, I’ve been making most of my meals at home to avoid being in crowded restaurants and to save money. I’ve been trying to teach myself how to recreate my favorite dishes from Ann Arbor restaurants (like Fleetwood Diner’s hippie hash or Kang’s bibimbap and kimchi fried rice) and how to make Vietnamese food, but there are times I will just make myself something quick and easy. I also love to have friends over for dinner, and I can’t wait for when it’s safe to do that again!</p>
